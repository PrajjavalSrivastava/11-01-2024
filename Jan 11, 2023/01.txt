Word-Break-2 Algorithm:
We start scanning the sentence from the left. As we find a valid word, we need to check whether the rest of the sentence can make valid words or not.

Because in some situations the first found word from the left side can leave a remaining portion that is not further separable

To keep track of the found words we will use a stack.

Whenever the right portion of the string does not make valid words, we pop the top string from the stack and continue finding.
